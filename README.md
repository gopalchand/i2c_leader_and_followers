# i2c_master_and_slaves
Created by Gopal Chand

## What is it?
Lights out management using an Arduino. 

An Arduino i2c master checks the status of Raspberry Pi 3, Linux or Windows速 i2c slaves and reboots them through a hardware reset if necessary. The reboot can be forced if required through a web page code downloaded using an Ethernet shield.

An i2c tutorial can be found here: https://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/i2c-tutorial

## When would I need it?
Remote hardware with internet connectivity that requires physical hardware reboots after becoming non-reseponsive on the network.

## Hardware pre-requisites
Arduino Uno Board (i2c master)

Arduino ethernet shield e.g. WizNet Wiz550io

Raspberry Pi 3 B+ with BCM2837xx GPIO chip (i2c slave)

FTDI UMFT201XB-WE Development Board for Ubuntu or Windows速 (i2c slave)

Logic Level Converter e.g. KeeYees 4 Channels IIC I2C Logic Level Converter Bi-Directional Module 3.3V to 5V Shifter for Arduino (convert Arduino +5V to Raspberry Pi and FTDI UMFT201XB-WE +3.3V).

## Hardware for device resets
PC prototyping board e.g. Gikfun Prototype Shield DIY KIT For Arduino UNO R3 Mega 328P

Up to 2 of the following (1 for each slave)

  10K resistor
  
  100K resistor
  
  BC108 transistor
  
Optional buzzer

## Hardware schematic

## Arduino Uno Master installation
Note: If the return IP address is 0.67.67.67 then the Ethernet library may be too old e.g. Linux Arduino installation. Compile on a Windows system with a an IDE version of 1.8.12 or higher and upload.

## Ubuntu slave installation
Download appropriate 16-bit or 32-bit D2XX drivers for Linux from https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm

Download the readme file: https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm

Extract to /root/libftd2xx (rename with a .tar extension may be necessary)

cp release/build/libftd2xx.* /usr/local/lib
chmod 0755 /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx*
ln -sf /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so.1.4.8 /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so

change 1.4.8 to the latest version if necessary

Copy Makefile and main.cpp to release/examples/heartbeat_i2c

Ensure that installed modules do not interfere with D2XX driver access by editing /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
add:
blacklist usb_wwan
blacklist qserial
blacklist usbserial
blacklist ftdi_sio

reboot

run make in hearbeat_i2c  
run heartbeat_i2c

## Windows速 slave installation
Download Windows速 driver from https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm

Download the appropriate installation guide and follow the instructions: https://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/InstallGuides.htm

## Raspberry pi Installation (model 3 only)
Background: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/76109/raspberry-as-an-i2c-slave

Install pigpio:

wget https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd pigpio-master
make
sudo make install

## Known limitations
Raspberry Pi 3 is required. The Raspberry Pi 4 has the BCM2711 chip and is not supported in this code.

Raspberry Pi not using interrupts and CPU loading will occur.

The BCM2837 i2c slave using the Broadcom Serial Controller (BSC) does not support clock stretching or DMA.
